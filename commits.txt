- Core:
  - Implemented dynamic loading of applications, icons, and windows from a central `applicationsData` array, replacing hardcoded HTML.
  - Introduced icon management using a single sprite sheet (`images/icons.png`) and a `getSpriteIconStyles()` helper for efficiency.

- New UI Elements & Features:
  - Added a full boot screen simulation (`#bootScreen`) with logo, loading animation, and copyright, shown on first visit or reboot.
  - Enhanced taskbar (`#taskbarApps`) to dynamically display items for open windows with icons and titles.
  - Added a notification area (`#notificationArea`) to the taskbar.
  - Implemented live time and date display in the notification area, updating every second.
  - Integrated weather display in the notification area, fetching data from Open-Meteo API based on user's location.
  - Added an info popup (`#infoPopup`), accessible from the notification area, displaying user's IP (via IPify API) and approximate location (via IP-API.com).
  - Introduced a desktop icon selection box (`#selectionBox`) for drag-to-select functionality.
  - Added a `favicon.ico`.

- Enhanced Existing Features:
  - Overhauled desktop icon layout (`refreshDesktopIconsLayout`) to be responsive and dynamic, with icon scaling based on available space.
  - Updated Start Menu to be dynamically populated from `applicationsData`, including support for pinned items.
  - Replaced "Turn Off Computer" with a functional "Reboot Website" button in Start Menu (simulates reboot, clears state, shows boot screen).
  - Replaced "Log Off" with a functional "Go to Github" button in Start Menu.  
  - Enabled rich HTML content within application windows, defined in `applicationsData`, allowing for more complex app interfaces.
  - Improved window z-index management and interactivity.

- API Integrations:
  - Fetches user's public IP (api.ipify.org).
  - Fetches geolocation based on IP (ip-api.com).
  - Fetches current weather data (api.open-meteo.com).

- Code & Performance:
  - Refactored JavaScript for better modularity and use of constants.
  - Implemented asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for API calls.
  - Added debounced resize handler for efficient desktop icon relayout.
